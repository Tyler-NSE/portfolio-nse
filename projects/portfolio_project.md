# Github Pages Minimal Theme Portfolio

This is the first project on my list because one of the most important things you can do is market yourself. This process was one of the easiest and most efficient ways I could find to create a personal portfolio website. Github pages is professional and easy to maintain without extensive coding knowledge. The last thing anyone needs is something breaking 5-10 years down the road and no idea how to fix it.

## Step 1

###Signing up for a new personal account:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/.
2. Click Sign up.
3. Alternatively, click on Continue with Google to sign up using social login.
4. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

## Step 2

### Creating a GitHub Pages Site:

There are multiple ways to perform this step but I chose to use a theme supported by GitHub Pages. These can be found at [https://github.com/pages-themes/](https://github.com/pages-themes/). I recommend the "minimal" theme, which has a professional feel and is the easiest to maintain for someone new to coding. A page can also be created without a theme if desired.

1. Login to GitHub
* Login to your GitHub account.
* Browse to your desired theme. For examlpe https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal.
2. Fork the Repository
* Click the Fork button on the top right to create a new fork.
* Name the repository as <username>.github.io (replace <username> with your GitHub username).
* Click "Create fork".
3. Enable GitHub Pages:
* Navigate to the repository's Settings.
* Scroll down to the Pages section.
* Under "Source", select the branch (e.g., main) and folder (e.g., /root) where your website files are located.
* Click Save.
5. Access Your Site
* Once enabled, your site will be live at https://<username>.github.io/.
* This may take a few minutes and go to the Actions tab to monitor the status.

### Key and Important Files

* The "index.html" file will serve as the homepage of your site.
* The "_config.yml" file is the configuration file used for customizing this static site. It will allow you to set the title, description, author information, theme settings, and more.
